1.A page can have only one head and one body element. The head element contains processing info and document metadata, things not visible to site visitors. The body element contains all content and data that is displayed on the browser's page, these are visible and interactive for the site visitors.
2.The difference between structural and semantic markup is that structural markup deals with the structure of a document like the heading, paragraphs, lists etc. Where the semantic markup deals with the information of a document like the quotations, emphasis, links to definitions etc.
3.I started out with the elements and filled everything in slightly out of order but I pretty much started with the structure and then began putting in the other additional details on top.
