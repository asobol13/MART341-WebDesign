1. I've come across all kinds of forms, never really knowing what they were called or how they operated. I've seen all of the ones we covered this week. These are used to get input from the user, whether it be predictable or unpredictable there are ways to receive answers.
2.An example of a text input would be a text box where you would put your name or username. The user is able to type in available info to the browser. An example of a selection input would be either buttons or checkboxes where you select a certain answer. The user knows what's expected this way it restricts possible answers. An example of a button input would be the search icon in a search bar that submits or enters input in. 
3.For this assignment I again got the basic structure down and then I added details. I always tend to go in order of the list on the homework as well.
