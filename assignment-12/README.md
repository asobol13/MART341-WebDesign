1. The difference between padding, margin, and borders are that the padding gives cushion between the inner content and the element itself, the margin is the cushion between the element and other elements, and the borders outline the content.
2. The challenges I had this week were the dang dropdown menu!!! I had a hard time getting it to show up for some reason but it ended up being some messed up organizing with my divs. I need to be more careful with the initial set up in my index. I find that I miss or mess up the little things then it takes me forever to figure out what I did and then it's a fairly easy fix. I had the same issues when coding in python and java as a CS major too, easy fix though!
