          <p>More than simply melding information together in creative ways, REM-sleep dreaming can take things a step further. REM sleep is capable of creating <span class=”emphasis”>abstract</span> overarching knowledge and super-ordinate concepts out of sets of information. Think of an experienced physician who is able to seemingly intuit a diagnosis from the many tens of varied, subtle symptoms she observes in a patient. While this kind of abstractive skill can come after years of hard-earned experience, it is also the very same accurate gust extraction that we have observed REM sleep accomplishing within just one night.</p>

        <!--Paragraph two-->
        <div class="paragraph-two">
          <p>A delightful example is observed in infants abstracting complex grammatical rules in a language they must learn. Even eighteen-month-old babies have been shown to deduce high-level grammatical structure from novel languages they hear, but only after they have slept following the initial exposure. As you will recall, REM sleep is especially dominant during this early-life window, and it is that REM sleep that plays a critical role in the development of language, we believe. But that benefit extends beyond infancy--very similar results have been reported in adults who are required to learn new language and grammar structures.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-three">
          <p>Perhaps the most striking proof of sleep-inspired insight, and one I most frequently describe when giving talks to start-up, tech, or innovative business companies to help them prioritize employee sleep, comes from a study conducted by Dr. Ullrich Wagner at the University of Lübeck, Germany. Trust me when I say you’d really rather not be a participant in these experiments. Not because you have to suffer extreme sleep deprivation for days, but because you have to work through hundreds of miserably laborious number-string problems, almost like having to do long division for an hour or more. Actually “laborious” is far too generous a description. It’s possible some people have lost the will to live while trying to sit and solve hundreds of these number problems! I know, I’ve taken the test myself.</p>
        </div>
        <!--Paragraph four-->
        <div class="paragraph-four">
          <p>You will be told that you can work through these problems using specific rules that are provided at the start of the experiment. Sneakily, what the researchers do not tell you about is the existence of a hidden rule, or shortcut, common across all the problems. If you figure out this embedded cheat, you can solve many more problems in a far shorter time. I’ll return to this shortcut in just a minute. After having had participants perform hundreds of these problems, they were to return twelve hours later and once again work through hundreds more of these mind-numbing problems. However, at the end of the second test session, the researchers asked whether the subjects had cottoned on to the hidden rule. Some of the participants spent that twelve-hour time delay awake across the day, while others, that time window included a full eight-hour night of sleep.</p>
        </div>
        <!--Paragraph five-->
        <div class="paragraph-five">
          <p>After time spent awake across the day, despite the chance to consciously deliberate on the problem as much as they desired, a rather paltry 20 percent of participants were able to extract the embedded shortcut. Things were very different for those participants who had obtained a full night of sleep-- one dressed with late-morning, REM-rich slumber. Almost 60 percent returned and had the “ah-ha!” moment of spotting the hidden cheat-- which is a threefold difference in creative solution insight afforded by sleep!</p>
