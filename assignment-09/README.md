1. I came into this class with a little bit of knowledge in computer science so I really didn't know a whole lot about HTML so everything was new to me. It was all super exciting and fun to learn and actually create and be able to see what I created. I had some obstacles in certain projects but they weren't anything I couldn't understand, it was mainly little things that needed either more practice or a little bit more attention to the details. 
2. I am just really excited for what's to come, I have had a lot of fun learning everything thus far and I think I will be really excited to see the progress and to expand my knowledge.
3. The biggest challenge for me was honestly trying to think of what I wanted to make my instructional page about. I had such a hard time because I could do anything so narrowing down my options was pretty tough. I was finally able to choose I just had to do a bit of brainstorming and be decisive.
