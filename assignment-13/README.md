1. My imaginary client was someone who wanted a Christmas cookie website. They wanted a simple layout with fun Christmas colors and pictures that will catch your eye. 
2. It's important to consider mobile-first design because most people use their phones to look things up nowadays and it's important to cater to that audience as well. If you can make a good impression on the mobile users you'll get more business and happier people. It's always a pain when a mobile site won't work correctly or doesn't look right.
3. The challenges I had this week were getting the layout to look the way I wanted and also getting the right colors. It feels a little bare to me and I need to work on the colors a bit more but I feel like I am getting the hang of things slowly but surely!
