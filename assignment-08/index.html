      <h4>Lyrics:</h4>
      <p>Be careful, it's my heart.</p>
      <p>It's not my watch you're holding, it's my heart.</p>
      <p>It's not the note I sent you that you quickly burned.</p>
      <p>It's not the book I lent you that you never returned.</p>
      <p>Remember it's my heart.</p>
      <p>The heart with which so willingly I part.</p>
      <p>It's yours to take to keep or break,</p>
      <p>But please, before you start,</p>
      <p>Be careful, it's my heart.</p>
